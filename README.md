# aws-terraform-module-cloudfront-s3-redirect
---

This project is part of our open source DevSecOps adoption approach. 

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

This module deploys and configures a S3 website behind a Cloudfront distribution, allowing you to do a serverless domain name redirect. In order to use this module we assume the following is present:

* it runs HTTPS via Amazon's Certificate Manager ("ACM")
* its domain is backed by a Route53 zone
* and of course, your AWS account provides you access to all these resources necessary.

This module is a pair with
[aws-terraform-module-cloudfront](https://github.com/osodevops/aws-terraform-module-cloudfront),
which handles hosting of a static S3 website with CloudFront and ACM.

A diagram of the solution can be seen below:

The solution consists of the following services:
* TO BE UPDATED

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:
```hcl
# AWS Region for S3 and other resources
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
  alias = "main"
}

# AWS Region for Cloudfront (ACM certs only supports us-east-1)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  alias = "cloudfront"
}

# Variables
variable "fqdn" {
  description = "The fully-qualified domain name root of the resulting S3 website."
  default     = "example.com"
}

variable "redirect_target" {
  description = "The fully-qualified domain name to redirect to."
  default     = "www.example.com"
}

# Using this module
module "main" {
  source = "github.com/osodevops/aws-terraform-module-cloudfront-s3-redirect"

  fqdn = "${var.fqdn}"
  redirect_target = "${var.redirect_target}"
  ssl_certificate_arn = "${aws_acm_certificate_validation.cert.certificate_arn}"

  validation_record_fqdns = ["${aws_route53_record.cert_validation.fqdn}"]
}

# Route 53 record for the static site

    zone_id = "${module.main.cf_hosted_zone_id}"
    evaluate_target_health = false
